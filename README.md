# fashion-mnist-cnn
This allows one to train a convolutional neural network with the fashion MNIST dataset. 

# Description 
- The training process uses function "train_cnn_model" from the model_training module. 
- The demo notebook shows the use of this function. in the demo, only a subset of the data is used. fmnist2 enables one to import a different subset of the data.
- The dataset provided is a version of the fashion MNIST loaded from PyTorch. The dataset was originally given here: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist. 

# Packages
Works with:
- Python 3.9.7
- PyTorch 1.13.1
- Torchvision 0.12.0+cu102
- Numpy 1.20.3
